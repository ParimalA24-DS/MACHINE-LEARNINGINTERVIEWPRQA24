## Introduction

This document lists the key interview questions and answers for various machine learning algorithms. These questions are crucial for understanding fundamental concepts and performing well in interviews.

## Linear Regression

**Q1:** What is Linear Regression?
**A:** Linear Regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

**Q2:** What is the cost function in Linear Regression?
**A:** The cost function is the Mean Squared Error (MSE).

**Q3:** Explain the concept of multicollinearity.
**A:** Multicollinearity occurs when independent variables are highly correlated.

## Logistic Regression

**Q1:** What is Logistic Regression?
**A:** Logistic Regression is used for binary classification problems. It predicts the probability of the target variable belonging to a certain class.

**Q2:** How is the logistic function defined?
**A:** The logistic function is defined as \( \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \).

**Q3:** What is the confusion matrix?
**A:** The confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.

## Decision Trees

**Q1:** What is a Decision Tree?
**A:** Decision Trees are non-parametric models used for classification and regression. They split the data into subsets based on the value of input features.

**Q2:** What is entropy in Decision Trees?
**A:** Entropy measures the impurity or uncertainty in a dataset.

**Q3:** What is Gini impurity?
**A:** Gini impurity is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element would be incorrectly identified.

## Random Forest

**Q1:** What is a Random Forest?
**A:** Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to improve the model's accuracy.

**Q2:** How does Random Forest handle overfitting?
**A:** By averaging multiple decision trees, Random Forest reduces the risk of overfitting.

**Q3:** What is feature importance in Random Forest?
**A:** Feature importance measures how important each feature is in making predictions.

## Support Vector Machine

**Q1:** What is a Support Vector Machine (SVM)?
**A:** SVM is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks, which finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates the classes.

**Q2:** What is the kernel trick in SVM?
**A:** The kernel trick allows SVM to solve non-linear problems by transforming the input features into higher-dimensional space.

**Q3:** What are support vectors?
**A:** Support vectors are the data points that are closest to the hyperplane and influence its position.

## K-Nearest Neighbors

**Q1:** What is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)?
**A:** KNN is a non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression, which classifies a data point based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors.

**Q2:** How is the value of k chosen in KNN?
**A:** The value of k is chosen based on cross-validation, balancing between overfitting and underfitting.

**Q3:** What is the distance metric used in KNN?
**A:** Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and Minkowski distance.

## Naive Bayes

**Q1:** What is the Naive Bayes algorithm?
**A:** Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence between features.

**Q2:** What is Bayes' theorem?
**A:** Bayes' theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event.

**Q3:** Why is it called "naive" Bayes?
**A:** It is called "naive" because it assumes that all features are independent, which is rarely true in real-world data.
